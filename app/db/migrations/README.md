# Database Migrations

This directory contains the migration files for the Fuel Tracker application's database schema. 

## Migration Management

Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema over time. Each migration file represents a specific change, such as creating a new table, adding a column, or modifying existing structures.

### Tools

We recommend using a migration tool such as Alembic to handle database migrations in this project. Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.

### Creating Migrations

To create a new migration, use the following command:

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of the migration"
```

This will generate a new migration file in the migrations directory.

### Applying Migrations

To apply the migrations to the database, run:

```
alembic upgrade head
```

This command will apply all pending migrations to the database.

### Rollback Migrations

If you need to revert a migration, you can use:

```
alembic downgrade <revision>
```

Replace `<revision>` with the specific migration identifier you wish to revert to.

### Best Practices

- Always review autogenerated migration files to ensure they accurately reflect the intended changes.
- Test migrations in a development environment before applying them to production.
- Keep migration files organized and well-documented for future reference.
